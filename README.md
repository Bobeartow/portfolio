### Currently a student at Epicodus

# About
I've been learning Web Development concepts for over 3 years now. I worked for a company called Acutulus Ent. where I spent the majority of my time focused on UX design and some Front End Development. I started attending Epicodus to expand my programming knowledge, as I didn't get the opportunity to during my time with Acutulus.

I look forward to my future career as a Front End Developer, and am always looking for a new challenge.
